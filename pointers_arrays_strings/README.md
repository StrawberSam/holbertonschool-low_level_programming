0 - Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
1 - Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.
2 - Write a function that returns the length of a string.
3 - Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to sdout.
4 - Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
5 - Write a function that reverse a string.
6 - Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
7 - Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line. If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string + 1) / 2.
8 - Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line. where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed. Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space. The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array. You are allowed to use printf.
9 - Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
10 - Write a function that convert a string to an integer. The number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters. You need to take into account all the - and + signs before the number. If there are no numbers in the string, the function must return 0. You are not allowed to use long. You are not allowed to declare new variable of type array and hard-code special values.
